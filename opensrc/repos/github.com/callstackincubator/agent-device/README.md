# agent-device

`agent-device` is a CLI for UI automation on iOS, tvOS, macOS, Android, and AndroidTV. It is designed for agent-driven workflows: inspect the UI, act on it deterministically, and keep that work session-aware and replayable.

If you know Vercel's [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser), this project applies the same broad idea to mobile apps and devices.

## Project Goals

- Give agents a practical way to understand mobile UI state through structured snapshots.
- Keep automation flows token-efficient enough for real agent loops.
- Make common interactions reliable enough for repeated automation runs.
- Keep automation grounded in sessions, selectors, and replayable flows instead of one-off scripts.

## Core Ideas

- Sessions: open a target once, interact within that session, then close it cleanly.
- Snapshots: inspect the current accessibility tree in a compact form and get stable refs for exploration.
- Refs vs selectors: use refs for discovery, use selectors for durable replay and assertions.
- Human docs vs agent skills: docs explain the system for people; skills provide compact operating guidance for agents.

## Command Flow

The canonical loop is:

```bash
agent-device open SampleApp --platform ios
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device press @e3
agent-device diff snapshot -i
agent-device fill @e5 "test"
agent-device close
```

In practice, most work follows the same pattern:

1. `open` a target app or URL.
2. `snapshot -i` to inspect the current screen.
3. `press`, `fill`, `scroll`, `get`, or `wait` using refs or selectors.
4. `diff snapshot` or re-snapshot after UI changes.
5. `close` when the session is finished.
