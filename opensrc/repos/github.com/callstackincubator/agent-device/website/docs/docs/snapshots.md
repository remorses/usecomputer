# Snapshots

Snapshots provide a structured view of the UI and generate stable refs.

```bash
agent-device snapshot                    # Full accessibility tree
agent-device snapshot -i                 # Interactive elements only (recommended)
agent-device snapshot -c                 # Compact (remove empty elements)
agent-device snapshot -d 3               # Limit depth to 3 levels
agent-device snapshot -s "Contacts"      # Scope to label/identifier
agent-device snapshot -i -c -d 5         # Combine options
agent-device diff snapshot               # Structural diff vs previous session baseline
```

| Option       | Description               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `-i`         | Interactive-only output   |
| `-c`         | Compact structural noise  |
| `-d <depth>` | Limit tree depth          |
| `-s <scope>` | Scope to label/identifier |

Note: If XCTest returns 0 nodes (foreground app changed), agent-device fails explicitly.
It does not automatically switch to AX.

## Efficient snapshot usage

- Default to `snapshot -i` for agent loops.
- Add `-s "<label>"` (or `-s @ref`) to keep results screen-local.
- Add `-d <depth>` when you only need upper hierarchy layers.
- Re-snapshot after any UI mutation before reusing refs.
- Use `diff snapshot` between mutations to validate structural changes with lower output volume.
- Keep `--raw` for troubleshooting only.

`diff snapshot` behavior:
- First run initializes baseline (`baselineInitialized: true` in JSON).
- Later runs return unified-style lines (`+` added, `-` removed, unchanged context) and update baseline after each call.

## Example output:

```bash
agent-device snapshot -i
# Output:
# Snapshot: 44 nodes
# @e1 [application] "Contacts"
#   @e2 [window]
#     @e3 [other]
#   @e4 [other] "Lists"
#     @e5 [navigation-bar] "Lists"
#       @e6 [button] "Lists"
#       @e7 [text] "Contacts"
#     @e8 [other] "John Doe"
#       @e9 [other] "John Doe"
```

## Backends (iOS):

- `xctest` (default): full fidelity, fast, no Accessibility permission required.
- `ax`: fast accessibility tree, may miss details, requires Accessibility permission; simulator-only.
